A customizable web-based **visual scheduling tool** designed to support individuals—especially those in the autism community—by providing structure, predictability, and independence through routines.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is inspired by my experience as a parent of an autistic child and my desire to create tools that offer real-world support for neurodiverse individuals.

The Visual Daily Scheduler will allow users to:
- Create and manage daily routines using visual blocks (with icons/images)
- Drag-and-drop tasks into a timeline
- Save routines for reuse and editing
- Get optional alerts or transition cues
- Use across devices (mobile-first, responsive design)

## 💡 Motivation

Many existing tools are either too complex, commercialized, or not customizable enough for daily life. My goal is to build something:

- Simple and accessible
- Free and open-source
- Easily customizable by caregivers, educators, or individuals

I'm also actively seeking feedback from other parents and caregivers to ensure this tool is genuinely helpful—not just well-intentioned.

## 🚧 Project Status

**In Progress** – Early development using React. Functional components are being built iteratively.

- [x] Project setup with React
- [ ] UI layout & drag-and-drop system
- [ ] Visual block/task library
- [ ] Routine saving (localStorage or Firebase)
- [ ] Responsive styling for mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Optional transition alerts or sounds
- [ ] Accessibility enhancements (keyboard/screen reader support)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React** (Create React App)
- **HTML/CSS/JS (JSX)**
- **Drag-and-drop library** – likely [`react-beautiful-dnd`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment
- **(Optional later)** Firebase or Supabase for user accounts and cloud storage

## 🚀 Deployment

The project will be deployed using **GitHub Pages** via the `gh-pages` branch. Once live, the link will appear here:
